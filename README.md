## Hey 👋, I'm Bogusz!  

### Glad to see you here!  
I enjoy tackling challenging tasks on the computer, and I believe that being a programmer is one of them. During my free time, I focus on learning Front-End development and honing my skills by working on smaller projects using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, with the latter being the most enjoyable for me.

A team that chooses to include me will gain a highly motivated individual who is eager to work and learn. Although Front-End development still holds many mysteries for me, I am dedicated to pursuing my goal of driving change within the industry.

In the near future, my plan is to continually improve my skills and embark on learning React. Gaining commercial experience would provide an excellent opportunity for personal growth.

Projects: All of my designs are constantly evolving and still a work in progress. The designs in my portfolio prioritize functionality, and visual aesthetics are not currently the primary focus during the production stage.


<br/>  
  I am ready to start working immediately
