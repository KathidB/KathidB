## Hey 👋, I'm Bogusz!  

### Glad to see you here!  
I enjoy tackling challenging tasks on the computer, and I believe that being a programmer is one of them. During my free time, I focus on learning Front-End development and honing my skills by working on smaller projects using HTML/CSS and JavaScript, with the latter being the most enjoyable for me.

A team that chooses to include me will gain a highly motivated individual who is eager to work and learn. Although Front-End development still holds many mysteries for me, I am dedicated to pursuing my goal of driving change within the industry.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning and coding in React.

<br/>  
  I am ready to start working immediately
