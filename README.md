## Hey 👋, I'm Bogusz!  
  



### Glad to see you here!  
I enjoy doing things on the computer that are challenging, and I think being a programmer is one of them. I spend my free time learning Front-End and developing my skills doing smaller projects using HTML/CSS and JS, the latter of which gives me the most pleasure.

The team which decides to take me in their ranks will gain a very motivated person to work and learn. Front-End still has many mysteries before me, but I carefully pursue my goal to change the industry.

Shortly, I plan to constantly improve my skills and soon start learning React. Gaining commercial experience would be an excellent opportunity for me to grow.
