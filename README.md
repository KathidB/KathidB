## Hey 👋, I'm Bogusz!  

All my designs are constantly improved and still being worked on. The designs in the portfolio are focused on functionality, and it was not a priority for them to look good visually at the current stage of production. 

### Glad to see you here!  
I enjoy doing things on the computer that are challenging, and I think being a programmer is one of them.
<br>
I spend my free time learning Front-End and developing my skills doing smaller projects using HTML/CSS and JS, the latter of which gives me the most pleasure.

The team which decides to take me in their ranks will gain a very motivated person to work and learn.
<br>Front-End still has many mysteries before me, but I carefully pursue my goal to change the industry.

Shortly, I plan to constantly improve my skills and soon start learning React.
<br>Gaining commercial experience would be an excellent opportunity for me to grow.  


<br/>  
  I am ready to start working immediately
